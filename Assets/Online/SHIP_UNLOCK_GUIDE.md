## Customization Guide

### How to Add New Ships

Edit `ProgressionSystem.cs`:

```csharp
private static readonly Dictionary<int, ShipUnlockData> SHIP_UNLOCKS = new Dictionary<int, ShipUnlockData>
{
    // Add your new ship here:
    { 15, new ShipUnlockData("my_new_ship", "My Ship Name", ShipClass.Tank, "Ship description") },
};
```

### How to Change Unlock Levels

```csharp
// Move Nova Class from Level 3 to Level 5:
{ 5, new ShipUnlockData("nova_class", "Nova Class", ShipClass.AllAround, "...") },
```

### How to Remove Ships

Simply delete the entry from the dictionary:

```csharp
// Remove this line to remove the ship:
// { 7, new ShipUnlockData("phoenix_mk1", "Phoenix Mk-I", ...) },
```

### How to Change Ship Names

```csharp
// Change display name (keeps same ID for game logic):
{ 3, new ShipUnlockData("nova_class", "Super Nova", ShipClass.AllAround, "New description") },
